# 🚀  Advancements in Single-Phase Induction Motor Performance through Pole Configuration and Capacitor Integration

## 🎯 Objective
The aim of this project is to enhance the performance of a single-phase induction motor by employing a configuration with **4 poles** and a **capacitor**.

## 🛠️ Components
- 🔵 Circular cap
- ⚡ Capacitor 220μF
- 🔌 12V AC power supply
- 🧵 0.4mm copper wire
- 📌 Plastic tape

## 🔧 Circuit Design
The capacitor is connected in series with the motor winding to introduce a **phase shift**. The use of **4 poles** is designed to optimize the interaction of the magnetic field.

## ⚙️ Working Principle
The system utilizes **4 poles** and a **capacitor** to generate a **rotating magnetic field**, thereby enhancing the **starting torque** crucial for efficient motor operation.

## 🧪 Experimental Setup
The motor, capacitor, and power supply are interconnected. Various capacitor values and pole configurations are tested, with **300 turns of coil wound** over the pole.

## 📊 Results and Outcome
Observations indicate increased **starting torque** and smoother operation with the implementation of **4 poles** and a **capacitor**. Detailed measurements and observations are documented.

## 🚧 Challenges
Challenges, such as optimizing capacitor values and pole alignment, are addressed through **iterative experimentation**.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
Future work may involve exploring refined capacitor values and pole configurations to further enhance efficiency and overall motor performance.
